# Vanilla-art

Simply said, VanillaArt is a site for any kind of art. You will find anything from masterfully done pieces of landscape 
to stuff that will gross you out. its a good hit at what you can find there too, althought such stuff is in minority and you can filter it.

It's a community website for creative people. It is a place where you can post your art
 (no matter what form it takes) to share and get feedback on, a place where artists, even amateur-level artists, can post their works publicly and let others
 to leave comments, reviews, or hit the favorite button on their artworks. DeviantArt is great primarily for
 beginner and aspiring artists because it lets you showcase your work, mingle with others who are artists by 
themselves (even artists of specific interest(s), e.g. fans of a certain celebrity/movie/series who draw fan-arts),
 and receive constructive feedbacks.
